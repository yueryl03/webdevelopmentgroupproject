<h3 style="text-align:center">A wonderful birthday gift</h3>
<p style="text-align:center">A great purchase! I purchased the LARQ water bottle for my husband who is always on the go and not always near filtered water when needing a refill. This is a great gift that will reduce your plastic waste footprints and keep you hydrated!</p>

  <h3 style="text-align:center">Love my straw. Wish it fit in the cup lid!</h3>
<p style="text-align:center">As someone who always needs a straw this product is great. For those of you asking if the straw is long enough for a Yeti, it certainly is (see picture). Iâ€™ve put this through the dishwasher a handful of times already and it is holding up well. One thing to be aware of is that the straw will not fit through the normal yeti slide lid. You will need the lid with the straw opening such as with the Rtic lid.</p>

  <h3 style="text-align:center">Unbelievable</h3>
  <p style="text-align:center">If you have a hydrogen refueling station nearby, this is your car! After completing the math, you will realize that you have a solid, heavy, quiet commuter, and Toyota pays you to drive. Plus, it's more rare on the Los Angeles road than Ferrari or Bentley, and as you walk a mile, you realize that your net worth is rising, and other cars can't do that! It is not Porsche.</p>
