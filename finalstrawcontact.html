   <h3>Question 2: Can I use my FinalStraw with hot drinks?


</h3>
   <div class="content">
     <div class="content-inner">
       <p>Sure! FinalStraw is down with all temperatures of liquids. The straw is dishwasher safe and can withstand temperatures of up to 250 degrees Fahrenheit. That’s pretty hot! (Please do not put your case in the dishwasher).

   <h3>Question 3:Do you have a return policy?</h3>
   <div class="content">
     <div class="content-inner">
       <p>It’s hard for us to imagine why you’d want to return your FinalStraw—we stand behind our pretty amazing products and offer a limited lifetime guarantee for product defects—but hey, sometimes things don’t work out and we want you to be happy. If you are dissatisfied with our product, we will accept your unused/unopened straw and give you a full refund within a 30 day window.</p>

   <h3>Question 4: Why is it taking so long for my FinalStraw to arrive?</h3>
   <div class="content">
     <div class="content-inner">
       <p>Trust us. We know. You wanted your FinalStraw like, yesterday. If we could instantaneously hyper-beam one of these things to you, we would. The reality is that we have to use a third-party to deliver your package. That means we can only guarantee when your purchase will be ready for shipment, not when it will arrive, though you can always track the package's progress via the tracking number. Please keep in mind that sometimes shit happens. Like blizzards, hurricanes, and good old fashioned goof-ups. While we cannot offer refunds for delays in shipping, our excellent customer service team will be happy to work with you and USPS to resolve any shipping questions or concerns. Thanks again for supporting FinalStraw. Please remember to always #SuckResponsibly.</p>
